INSTALL

(Dec 2016)

At this time the code is Mac centric. Although the executable
   derot
can be built without any Mac dependencies by commenting out the Mac
bundle part of the Makefile.

However, logs and help paths will be screwed up.  IMO, to get rid of
Macisms should not be too difficult. But I do not have Linux box or a
Windows box to check this.  The biggest change to make to make derot
not be Mac centric is to get rid of the Mac bundle.

To see where the Mac centric code is, just to a
   grep "__APPLE__" *.cpp *.hpp *.cxx *.h

Build requirements
==============

(1) The boost libraries must be installed.
    On a Mac, use macports
       port install boost

(2) The fltk libraries must be installed. fltk-1.3.4 works. fltk-1.3.3
     is actually quite unstable and and the earliest version that
     works is fltk-1.3.x-r10729.
     Download from www.fltk.org

(3) A dynamic bundler must be installed to make the derot.app bundle
    Download from
    	     https://github.com/auriamg/macdylibbundler

Edits
===
Edit Makefile.FLTK to point to where you've installed fltk. Change this:
     FLTKCONFIG   = ../fltk-1.3.4-1/fltk-config

Edit Makefile to point to where dylibbundler is installed
     DYLIBBUNDLER = ../macdylibbundler-master/dylibbundler

Build
===
	Run
		make


Install
====
The mac bundle
    derot.app
can be moved to /Applications using
    sudo mv derot.app /Applications
