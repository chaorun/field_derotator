# GUI Frontend

This is the GUI frontend that allows the user to control the field
derotator in the comfort of your nice warm house via WIFI. I have
built this on Mac OS X 10.10.5. Since the GUI library that I am using,
[fltk](http://www.fltk.org) is cross platform and supports Linux and
Windows, I believe that small changes are necessary for the GUI to
compile on them.

## Build requirements

The build requirements can be found in *derot/INSTALL.TXT* plus
comments on how to get it compiled on a Linux box. I don't know what
to do for a Windows box.
