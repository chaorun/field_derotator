# GUI Frontend

This is the GUI frontend that allows the user to control the field
derotator in the comfort of your nice warm house via WIFI. I have
built this on Mac OS X 10.10.5 and for Linux, I think small changes
will need to be made to make it compile. I don't have any information
on how to do this on a Windows machine.

## Build requirements

The build requirements can be found in *derot/INSTALL.TXT* plus
comments on how to get it compiled on a Linux box.
