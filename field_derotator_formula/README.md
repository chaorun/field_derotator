# Field Derotator Formula

I derived, from first principles, the derotation formula because I could
not find anyone who has published this online! There may be a easier
way to get to the formula, which IMO is intriguingly simple, but I
don't know of any other way than to do it than the way that I did.

After deriving this formula, I also show how field derotation actually
improves off-axis guiding and the limitations of field derotation.
