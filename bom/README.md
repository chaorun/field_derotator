# Bill of Materials

I present the estimated cost for building *one* field derotator here
to be $642. This is the lower bound for the cost of one such device
because, in practise, it is not possible to just buy 1 screw :) or is
cost effective to build just one part at
[eMachineshop](http://www.emachineshop.com). Plus, I did not include
tax or cost of shipping. I would imagine that if people banded
together build multiples of this device, the cost will cost will get
closer to $642.

The bom.ods file is readable using [LibreOffice Calc](http://www.libreoffice.org).

# Note

One cost that I did not include was the modification of two gears used
in this project. I had friends who were kind enough to use their lathe
and mill to perform the modifications essentially for free. See
[assembly instructions](../howto/assembly.pdf) for more information on
what modifications were made.
