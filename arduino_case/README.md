# Arduino case

This is the case that I designed for the controller. This design is based on the [slicecase](http://www.slicecase.com) style of cases. Unfortunately, it seems that slicecase is no longer in business.

The file *ponoko_upload.svg* file can be uploaded to [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com) for manufacture. The material that I used is

* Acrylic - Red TINT
* 3.0 mm thick
* P2 - 384.0 mm long x 384.0 mm wide
