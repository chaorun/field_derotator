# How to build the Field DeRotator

I have written these two documents to help you build and assemble a
field derotator.

## The documents

* **assembly.pdf** This guide tells you how I assembled the
  mechanical parts of the derotator. There's quite a bit to do to get
  mechanical parts painted and assembled. And glue is your friend :)
* **controller.pdf** This guide tells you how I assembled the
controller.
